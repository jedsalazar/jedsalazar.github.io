        <section class="about">
            <p>I build things at the edge of security and infrastructure. Distributed systems, OS internals, cryptography, observability, network engineering. The deep, unglamorous work that keeps everything else from falling apart.</p>

            <p>I didn't follow the traditional path into tech. I came up from the ground, spent years building skills the hard way, and landed at Google. Then a string of startups where I keep doing the same thing: showing up early and turning a promising idea into something real. It never gets easier. I keep signing up for it. Currently doing exactly that as Field CTO at <a href="https://edera.dev">Edera</a>.</p>

            <p>I grew up on O'Reilly books. Somehow I ended up <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/security-observability-with/9781492096719/">writing one</a>. Still processing that.</p>

            <p>When I'm not thinking about syscalls, I'm running ridgelines out of a van, chasing glaciers and coastline through the Pacific Northwest and Colorado with a dog that understands mountains better than I ever will. The endless bounty of wonder in nature &gt; xterm-256color.</p>

            <p>I care about deep technology, not trends. Privacy, not surveillance. Community, not clout.</p>
